        <p>
            The Walking Dead tells the story of the months and years that follow after a zombie apocalypse. It follows a group of survivors, led by former police officer Rick Grimes, who travel in search of a safe and secure home. As the world overrun by the dead takes its toll on the survivors, their interpersonal conflicts present a greater danger to their continuing survival than the walkers that roam the country. Over time, the characters are changed by the constant exposure to death and some grow willing to do anything to survive. Based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard.

        <div class="negan">
        <h3>Negan</h3>
        <p>
            Negan is shown to be a charismatic, cocky, manipulative, brutal, and ferocious man with a sarcastic, inappropriate sense of humor. Negan is a brilliant strategist and a strong, effective leader, having kept hundreds of people alive and is worshipped by many and feared by others. When he was leader of the Saviors, he was shown to have had complete control over his vast group and was questioned by no one, acting as a complete dictator.

    <div class="deryl">
        <h3>Daryl</h3>
        <p>Daryl is both a physically and mentally strong man who is often surly and very resourceful but his compassion and loyalty towards the people he cares about are second-to-none; despite his hardened personality, he is not without a soft, emotional side. He is often volatile, but still significantly more level-headed than his older brother, Merle Dixon. Though he is usually distant, Daryl has often shown to be caring and selfless.

    <div class="michonne">
        <h3>Michonne</h3>
        <p>
            Michonne is both a tough and a good hearted survivor. She tends to work alone and keeps much of her past secret, even towards Andrea, but possesses a keen sense of intuition. Michonne once said that she "trusts her gut" when it comes to other survivors. After the loss of her boyfriend, she suffered from hallucinations in which she would talk to him. It was revealed that she likes art and/or sculptures as she looted a cat sculpture and claimed that it was "too damn gorgeous".
